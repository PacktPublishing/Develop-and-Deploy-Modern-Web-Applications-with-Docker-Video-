## About the Video Course
Docker is a tool for containerizing applications with all their dependencies and deploy them into a production environment . Modern web applications are complex affairs consisting of interdependencies between frontend code, backend, and frameworks.

Do you find it difficult to deploy web applications and maintain dependencies? If so, this course will help you containerize your applications. You'll be able to work on complex operations without blocking your end users in the UI interface and do it easily by splitting the functionality in microservices. 
You’ll learn to test your back-end services, perform checks, and analyze your pipeline according to the project requirements. You’ll also understand the failures, check code coverage, and diagnose it. And if you still find any issues after deploying, then you can easily tackle them by editing and building after deployment.

By the end of the course, you’ll be able to deploy complex web applications easily and tackle any issues. So, grab this course to make your work easy as a developer!
